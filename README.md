# BookAppFB
This was my first Swift project. I used SwiftUI to create a small demo app with a book library and a sample book store similar to the music app on iOS. I used books from a list of the best books and scraped images for the books from Wikipedia using their API in Python. The books are stored in a Firestore backend.
